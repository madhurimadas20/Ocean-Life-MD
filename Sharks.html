		Sharks are a group of cartilaginous fish known for their distinct appearance, impressive adaptations, and often misunderstood nature. 
  </p>
	<p align="justify"><b>Diversity:</b>
	Sharks belong to the class Chondrichthyes, which also includes rays, skates, and chimaeras. 
	There are over 500 known species of sharks, varying greatly in size, shape, and behavior. 
	They can be found in a wide range of aquatic environments, from coastal areas to the open ocean.

	 <p align="justify"><b>Physical Characteristics:</b>
	Sharks are characterized by their streamlined bodies, powerful tails, and rows of sharp teeth. 
	Their skeletons are made of cartilage rather than bone, which makes them lighter and more flexible. 
	Their skin is covered in dermal denticles, which are tooth-like scales that reduce friction and help them swim efficiently.
	</p>
    <p align="justify"><b>Conservation Concerns:</b>
	Many shark species are facing threats due to overfishing, bycatch (accidental capture while targeting other species), habitat destruction, 
	and the demand for shark products such as fins, which are used in some traditional Asian dishes. 
	Some shark populations have declined significantly, 
	leading to conservation efforts to protect these important apex predators and maintain the health of marine ecosystems.
	</p>

     <p align='center'><img src="shark2.jpg" width="50%" height="250px"></p>
	 <p align="justify"><b>Ecological Importance:</b>
	Sharks play a crucial role in maintaining the health of marine ecosystems by regulating the populations of their prey species. 
	As apex predators, they help control the balance of marine food webs and prevent the overpopulation 
	of certain species that could otherwise lead to cascading ecological effects.
	 </p>
	 <p>In summary, sharks are a diverse group of fascinating creatures that have adapted to a wide range of aquatic environments.
	 They are important components of marine ecosystems and are a subject of scientific research 
	 and conservation efforts to better understand and protect their populations.
